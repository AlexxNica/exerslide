title: Maximum Image Size
chapter: Features
---
The default style sets the maximum width of each image inside the slide (the
`#exerslide-slide` element) to 100%, which makes it scale to the width of its 
container.

Example images:

<p>
  <img src="http://placehold.it/300x150" alt="Small example image" />
</p>
<img src="http://placehold.it/1200x150" alt="Wide example image" />
