Creating presentations can be difficult for visually impaired people. Most 
presentation tools primarily provide visual tools to organize and structure 
content.

Creating text files is usually easier for visually impaired people, but there 
is still the issue of how much of the content is actually visible on the screen 
when it is presented.

To help with that, exerslide includes alerts only visible to screen readers 
when a slide contains more content than is visibile on the screen, such as the 
following one:

```html
<span tabindex="0" role="alert" style="...">
  Attention: Only 33% of the slide content is visible
</span>
```

This allows authors to adjust the content, browser window size or the font 
size.

In addition to that we are trying to make the default components that come with 
exerslide accessible, such as the text editor component shown in the [custom 
layout example](#/custom_layout_example).
