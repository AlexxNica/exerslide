title: Foundation and Font Awesome
---

[Foundation][] (CSS only) and [Font Awesome][] are included as dependencies by 
default.  Since Markdown allows raw HTML, it is easy to have to readable source 
files and still create pleasant info boxes like

<div class="callout primary">
  <span class="fa fa-lg fa-info-circle"></span>
  This one.
</div>
