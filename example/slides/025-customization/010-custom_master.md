title: Custom master layout
---
The **master layout** defines the overall structure of the page / presentation.  
The default master layout is copied into the project folder so you can change 
it easily.

For example, this presentation customizes the master layout to include a header
at the top of the page:

```
@require(!!raw!../../js/MasterLayout.js)
```
