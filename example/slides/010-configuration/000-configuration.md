`exerslide init` copies a couple of files into the presentation folder, 
including configuration files. One of exerslide's goals is it to provide good 
defaults "out of the box", but also to allow customization wherever possible.

The two configuration files are

- `exerslide.config.js`: exerslide-specific configuration options
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuration, including exerslide specific and 
custom loaders to process slide files.
